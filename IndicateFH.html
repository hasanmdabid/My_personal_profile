          INDICATE-FH - New approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of food
          intolerances
        </h2>
        <p>
          More and more people are unable to tolerate wheat. The reason for this
          can be a wheat allergy or gluten intolerance (celiac disease), both of
          which are clearly defined illnesses. However, wheat intolerance often
          has other causes, the diagnosis of which has so far been very complex.
          The gastrointestinal symptoms are sometimes misdiagnosed as irritable
          bowel syndrome, leading to suboptimal treatment. The main goal of the
          "INDICATE-FH" project is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
          wheat-related food intolerances. To this end, the interdisciplinary
          project team will develop diagnostic procedures that can distinguish
          the various causes of wheat intolerance and differentiate them from
          irritable bowel syndrome. Among other things, a special form of
          endoscopy – confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) – is being optimized.
          The analysis of endoscopic images is to be improved using artificial
          intelligence. Several subprojects are also working on diagnosing wheat
          intolerances based on blood, saliva, or stool samples. Another
          approach is further developing an app that collects data from
          wearables and data on diet, lifestyle, and symptoms. Based on the
          findings on the diagnosis of wheat intolerance, patients can be
          offered a more specific, less stressful nutritional therapy in the
          future.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          I was involved in the project as a Data Scientist, focusing on the
          development of AI-based diagnostic tools and the analysis of data
          collected from various sources. Food hypersensitivity (FHS) is a
          relatively common pathological condition characterised by adverse
          reactions to specific foods, and that currently has limited diagnostic
          methods. Diagnostic tools using gastro-intestinal confocal laser
          endomicroscopy (CLE) images have recently been proposed for the
          assessment of FHS, but their interpretation can be challenging even
          for trained physicians. We propose to alleviate this problem by
          training machine learning models on CLE images of the
          gastro-intestinal tract for the binary classification problem of
          recognising images that show an adverse reaction to food intake. 
          My research shows that although all four models achieve satisfying 
          classification performances, they learn very different features in 
          terms of interpretability from the clinical perspective.

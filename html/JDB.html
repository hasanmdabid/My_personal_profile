          This project developed a sales forecasting model to predict
          half-hourly sales turnover for various products and store locations.
          It aimed to improve upon the limitations of the current Random Forest
          (RF) model, which struggles with fine-grained predictions and
          sequential data. The project explores and evaluates several advanced
          deep learning models, including DNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Mamba, and Hybrid
          models, which are better suited for handling complex time-series data. </br>
          The goal was to find a highly accurate model that could predict sales
          at a granular level, even with irregular sales patterns and frequent
          zero-turnover periods. The models were evaluated using a range of
          metrics (MAE, RMSE, WAPE) and different prediction approaches (direct,
          cumulative, and daily turnover) to ensure a comprehensive assessment.
          By demonstrating that deep learning models significantly outperform
          the existing RF method, this project provides a valuable solution for
          retailers to reduce costs, optimize inventory, and enhance customer
          satisfaction. The final report details the entire process, from data
          preparation and model training to evaluation and results analysis.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I played a key role in developing and implementing
            the sales forecasting model. I performed data preprocessing, feature
            engineering, and model selection to ensure optimal performance. I tested the state of
            of art deep learning models, including <b>DNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs</b>, to improve prediction accuracy.
            I tried to use transformer based model like Autoformer, and iTransformer, but their performance
            for the short-term prediction was not successful in this context.

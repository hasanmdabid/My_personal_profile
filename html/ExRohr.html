          AI powered Sewerage Pipe Inspection and Fault Detection.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The ExRohr project focuses on the development of an AI-powered system for the inspection and fault detection of sewerage pipes. 
          Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the project aims to automate the process of identifying defects and anomalies in sewer infrastructure. 
          This innovative approach not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of inspections but also reduces the need for manual labor, thereby minimizing costs and improving safety. 
          The system is designed to analyze video footage captured by inspection cameras, detecting issues such as cracks, blockages, and corrosion in real-time. 
          By providing timely and precise information about the condition of sewerage pipes, ExRohr contributes to better maintenance planning and prolongs the lifespan of critical infrastructure.

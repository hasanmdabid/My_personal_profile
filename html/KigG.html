          The KigG project utilizes innovative testing methods that simulate immunological processes outside the body to identify characteristic patterns. 
          This approach enables differentiated diagnostics that address the individual disease progression of patients. "With KigG, we can effectively bridge 
          the interface between basic research and clinical application, thus making a significant contribution to the further development of precision medicine," Dr. Hackel continued.
          expandAI GmbH supports the project with its expertise in machine learning and AI-based digitalization. Prof. Dr.-Ing. Marcin Grzegorzek, founder and shareholder of expandAI GmbH, 
          and Artur Piet, CEO of the company, contribute their technical and strategic experience to the development of the diagnostic technology. 
          The BMBF's DATIpilot funding guideline, with its "Innovation Sprints" module, offers a flexible and rapid way to translate innovative ideas into practice. Simplified application 
          processes and short project durations of a maximum of 18 months provide researchers with an experimental space to test forward-looking technologies. The KigG project exemplifies how 
          targeted knowledge transfer can generate concrete societal benefits from research results.

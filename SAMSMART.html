        <h2>
          Security assistance manager for the smart home
        </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of SAM-Smart is to improve the security of smart home devices
          and networks and to assist users in assessing and dealing with
          security risks. A key focus is on the development of AI-based security
          analysis and protective measures. The project follows a user-centered,
          iterative-incremental approach, aiming to develop, among other things,
          a voice-based assistance system. This system will help consumers
          assess specific risks of devices and make secure configurations.
          Additionally, a privacy dashboard will be developed to enhance data
          overview and control. At the core of the project is the "Security &
          Privacy Gateway," a technical component enabling the detection of IT
          risks and security incidents while resolving security-related
          disruptions. It will actively alert users to risks, provide
          information on security-related topics, and offer guidance. With the
          help of this gateway, several concepts will be explored and tested,
          including the development of an "Ambient Security Toolkit" for risk
          assessment and the creation of a collaborative testbed for pentesting
          and black- & white-box analysis of smart home devices. Another focal
          point of the project is researching and developing automated
          procedures for detecting security-relevant software flaws and
          suppressing unwanted information flows. This includes generating
          hotfixes when manufacturers do not provide updates. Moreover,
          privacy-preserving distributed machine learning methods for sensor
          correction will be investigated. The aim is to improve the quality of
          cost-effective sensors while ensuring data privacy. These procedures
          will be tested both under laboratory conditions and in real-world
          environments. The SAM-Smart project is a cooperation between open.INC
          GmbH, nuspace GmbH, automITe engineering GmbH, Langlauf GmbH, the
          University of Siegen and the Institutes of Medical Informatics and IT
          Security at the University of Lübeck. This project is funded by the
          BMBF under grant number 16KISA074.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            My role in the project as a Data Scientist, was focusing on the
            development of AI-based diagnostic tools and the analysis of data
            collected from various sources. My research includes the development
            of machine learning models for detecting security vulnerabilities in
            smart home devices and networks. I also work on creating a privacy
            dashboard that enhances user control over their data.
